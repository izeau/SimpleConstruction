## Micropad

Any instructions on how to use your new micro dock. Every time I try to build with it the new part is not attached the the parent, or it's upside down

> I had issues also - and had to experiment until I got it right - then save it as a subassembly (station arms) But once you get the hang of it...
>
> the best answer I have for the micropad (not the control reference which isn't what I thought it was, and has be depreciated) - is the [EL-Manual](http://taniwha.org/~bill/EL_Manual.pdf) - remember - this is the FULL manual and not written for SimpleConstruction!. I have also added that to the OP.

from page 14 (edited for clarity) [taniwah][taniwha] says:
> 2.5.3. Micro-PadThe micro-pad is a single-use construction point. When the build is finalized, the pad self-destructs and the build is attached to the parent vessel as if the build had been placed there in the editor (VAB or SPH). Also, the micro-pad can be carried on a kerbal’s back using KIS[5].
>  
> The orientation and position of the build is controlled by the combination of the orientation and position of the micro-pad, and the automatically selected attach node of the root part.  
>  
> The colored diamonds on the micro-pad indicate the orientation of the root part when its bottom node is selected (red = +X, blue = +Z, cyan = -X, yellow =-Z[14].
>  
>It is important to remember that when the micro-pad is facing up, the root part’s selected node will be facing down, having been rotated around the part’s Z axis.
>  
> The micro-pad automatically selects the attach node of the root part by searching for the first available (unattached) node. First the bottom node is checked, then the top node, then any remaining nodes in the order they are found. Thus a small amount of control over which node is selected can be obtained simply by attaching parts to the undesired nodes

note:  
x = left-to-right (red - cyan)  
y = top-to-bottom (blue)  
z = front-to-back (yellow)
